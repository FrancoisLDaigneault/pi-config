"""Documentation drift gate.

The docs state facts that the tooling also defines: test counts, quality-gate
commands, size caps, the coverage floor, the Python version. Each fact has a
machine-readable source of truth; this gate fails when a doc claim and its
source disagree, naming the file and both values. Only anchored patterns are
checked, never prose wording, so rephrasing stays free while numbers cannot
silently rot.
